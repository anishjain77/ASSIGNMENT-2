# Program: Sum of numbers from 1 to 50

# Step 1: Initialize a variable to store the sum
total = 0

# Step 2: Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to 50
for i in range(1, 51):
    total += i  # Add each number to total

# Step 3: Print the total sum
print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is:", total)
